## Using

To use FetLife Spyscope, [log in to your FetLife.com account](https://fetlife.com/login) and move your mouse over any link to a user's profile, such as avatar pictures or their nickname in your activity feed. A popup will appear showing all kinds of useful information about them.

For example, in the screenshot below, moving your cursor over user avatars in a group discussion listing reveals a pop-up:

When you hover your cursor over a FetLife username in an activity feed, the FetLife Spyscope also activates and displays information about that user:

Other uses for the FetLife Spyscope include:

* Roll your mouse over event attendee lists to quickly discover how many people attending a particular event identify as dominant men, switch females, or any other age/sex/roles.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Can the FetLife Spyscope show me X about a user?

Probably! If you'd like the Spyscope pop-up display to include more information about users than it currently does, I invite you to [submit a feature request](https://github.com/meitar/fetlife-spyscope/issues/new). The more requests for a particular type of information, the more likely I am to prioritize that feature request over others. :)
